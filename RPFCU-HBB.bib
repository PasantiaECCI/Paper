  abstract = {A 7 kW voltage-sourced reversible rectifier (VSRR) which achieves
	bidirectional power flow between a single-phase AC supply and a DC
	busbar voltage is described. A current-forced control (CFC) strategy
	is used to switch two power transistors, enabling the device to operate
	with a unity power factor and a sinusoidal line current to produce
	a regulated DC busbar voltage. The advantages of the scheme are its
	simplicity, an extremely fast and well damped response and its adaptive
	nature to nonlinear effects such as transistor switching delays.
	The device operates with a DC busbar voltage which is greater than
	the peak-to-peak voltage of the utility supply so that it is especially
	suitable for use as a source of power in a variable-speed AC induction-motor
	drive},

	boost converter circuit, which has been proposed earlier by other
	researchers, is presented with detailed analysis. This converter
	is capable of operating under variable PF. However, the focus of
	this paper is in achieving unity PF operation only. The efficiency
	of this circuit is high because there is only one series semiconductor
	on-state voltage drop at any instant. The existence of an imbalance
	in the voltages of the two DC-link capacitors, which was noted before,
	is confirmed here. The cause for the imbalance is analyzed using
	appropriate models, and a control method to eliminate it is discussed
	in detail. Analysis and design considerations for the power circuit
	using the fixed-band hysteresis current control (HCC) technique are
	provided. The analytical results are verified through simulation
	using switched and averaged circuit models of the scheme and also
	through experimental work. At 90-V AC input and 300-W 300-V output,
	the experimental prototype demonstrates an efficiency of 96.23% and
	a PF of 0.998. This converter, with its relatively high DC-output
